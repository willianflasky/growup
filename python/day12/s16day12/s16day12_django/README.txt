Introduction
------------

The world was in need of a simple Windows application to compute md5
checksums. So here it is. Just drag the files you want checksummed
into the window and out comes the appropriate info. Pretty
straightforward. If you drag an MD5SUM file, this program will 
automatically parse it and compare the hashes to both previously
hashed files and future files.
 
Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Version 2.0x uses the .NET runtime, which is freely available from Microsoft
at http://www.microsoft.com/net. Once the runtime is installed, just double
click on the executable. There is no "installation process"-- just a single .EXE.
I find it handy to keep a copy in my quicklaunch.
